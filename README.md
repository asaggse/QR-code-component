## My process
### Built with
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned
In this project, I learned more about responsive design and how to create a mobile-first approach in CSS. I also learned how to use the `transform` property to center an element horizontally and vertically.

```
.container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development
I want to continue developing my skills in CSS Grid, as well as explore more advanced techniques in responsive design.
